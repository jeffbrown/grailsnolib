BOOKS SAMPLE APPLICATION FOR GRAILS
===================================

This sample application demonstrates a simple page flow application that maintains a list of books.

The directory structure is:

<root>
  /grails-app
    /BookFlow.groovy
  /jsp
    /listBooks.jsp
    /bookDetail.jsp

This application clearly demonstrates how compact Grails applications are and how little configuration is required.

BUILDING
========

If you have obtained Grails from CVS make sure the JAR file is build by running this command in the Grails home directory: 

ant jar

To deploy this application set the GRAILS_HOME environment to the root directory of the Grails distribution or project.

At the command prompt change directory to the project root directory which is ${GRAILS_HOME}/samples/books.

Next run this command to initiate the dictory structure:

${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails init

If you get "permission denied", this file is not executable. In that case run the command as follows:

/bin/sh ${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails init

Then run this command to create the WAR file:

${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails war

This application is written against the Servlet 2.3 specifications so should run in any servlet container.

Deploy grails-app.war in you servlet container (for most containers this mean copying the file in the webapps folder).

Browse to http://<server_address>:<server_port>/grails-app/app/books to test the application. You can also rename the WAR file to use another context path.

Please post a message on the Grails mailing list if you experience any problems running this sample application.
